Certain things in this skin will only work a certain way for our platform...this is where
I will be posting that information (many things were altered internally to make them work
properly but all functionality should appear the same I hope.)  Some things were also
removed (pvr, menuTV, addon windows, etc) as they don't and more than likely never will
work on xbmc4xbox.  480p will flow well and should stay usable and nice...720p will more
than likely crash your box at this point.

--> CDArt folder must be set up manually in system/skin setings/general/music folder...
    the path must be entered as follows (no trailing "/" is the important thing here): 

	SHARE://Computer-Name/(User-pass)--if nescessary/folder name

				[OR]

        DRIVE(with desired folder)://(and then path to the local folder)

      		
    --- disc images go into the album folder and must be labeled "cdart.png" ---

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All I can think of at this point, I'm sure more things will be added here eventually.
